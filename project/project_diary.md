# Project diary

Introduction presentation done.

After the presentation we have set up a couple of times during the following weeks when
we can meet and work together.

I've requested access for Sofia and Yim for our project data to Sverker Lundin at
SciLifeLab, and shouldn't be any problem, just that Sofia and Yim will need to sign an
NDA (I'll send it by mail), and anything we say about the data (organism, etc), we have
to ask to the user.

I had a meeting with Phil Ewels to plan the project a little bit and try to figure
out what can be done in a month (he has been planning it internally). I've created
a [*public trello board*](https://trello.com/b/ilZxZc99/mirna-qc-metrics-project) for
the project plan.

- Use SRA data (just look for miRNA a.k.a small RNA data, and make sure it is human) until they have access
to the real data
- Within the real data, look for human samples
- Literature: Papers within the Pipeline planning document
- To SL: Do we have any crappy data? Can we reschedule the workshop?

Assigned project and project members. My mates will be Sofia Bergström and Yim Wing Chow.

I sent them an email with all the information I have for this project: Project
description and objectives (provisional) for the project. I will prepare the short
presentation for S1 tomorrow and after that we will meet and work around questions.

Proposed Git/GitHub as method for code versioning (strongly recommended) and for
the diary (personal).

Asked in SciLifeLab if it is possible to use customer data for the project. The
answer has been yes, _but_ we have to work around confidentiality issued, Yim and
Sofia will probably have to sign some sort of NDA, to be decided...
