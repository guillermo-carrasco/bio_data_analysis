# Project diary

### Guillermo Carrasco Hernández

### 2015-02-19

Assigned project and project members. My mates will be Sofia Bergström and Yim Wing Chow.

I sent them an email with all the information I have for this project: Project
description and objectives (provisional) for the project. I will prepare the short
presentation for S1 tomorrow and after that we will meet and work around questions.

Proposed Git/GitHub as method for code versioning (strongly recommended) and for
the diary (personal).

Asked in SciLifeLab if it is possible to use customer data for the project. The
answer has been yes, _but_ we have to work around confidentiality issued, Yim and
Sofia will probably have to sign some sort of NDA, to be decided...
